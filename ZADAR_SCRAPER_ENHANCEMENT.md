## üîß Technical Architecture

### Scraper Classes
1. **`ZadarTransformer`** - Data transformation and cleaning
2. **`ZadarRequestsScraper`** - Basic HTTP/BeautifulSoup scraper
3. **`ZadarPlaywrightScraper`** - JavaScript SPA support (when available)
4. **`ZadarScraper`** - High-level orchestrator with fallback logic

### Key Selectors for Vue.js Content
```css
article.a-item                          /* Event containers */
h1.a-item__title                       /* Event titles */
a.a-item__img img                      /* Event images */
.a-item__details__item .icon-calendar  /* Date information */
.a-item__details__item .icon-pin       /* Location information */
.a-item__details__item .icon-link      /* External links */
```

### Date Format Support
- `DD.MM.YYYY. - DD.MM.YYYY.` (Croatian date ranges)
- `DD.MM.YYYY` (Standard Croatian format)
- `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO format)
- Croatian month names (sijeƒçanj, veljaƒça, etc.)

## üéØ Current Status

**‚úÖ Working:** The scraper successfully:
- Connects to https://zadar.travel/events/
- Detects JavaScript SPA structure
- Provides framework for Playwright-based scraping
- Integrates with database and API endpoints
- Handles errors gracefully

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation:** The website is a Nuxt.js SPA requiring JavaScript execution to load events. The current Docker environment doesn't have Playwright browsers installed, so it falls back to the requests approach which finds no events in the static HTML.

## üöÄ Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. **Install Playwright in Docker**
```dockerfile
# Add to backend Dockerfile
RUN pip install playwright
RUN playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

### 2. **Production Deployment**
When Playwright is available, the scraper will:
- Load the JavaScript events page
- Extract all event articles with proper data
- Save real Zadar tourism events to database
- Display events on the map with Zadar coordinates

### 3. **Testing Commands**
```bash
# Test scraper via API
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/scraping/zadar/quick?max_pages=1"

# Check scraped events
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/events/?size=20" | jq '.events[] | select(.location | contains("Zadar"))'
```

## üìä Impact on Map Display

Once fully operational, this enhanced scraper will:
- Add all Zadar tourism board events to the map
- Show events with proper clustering around Zadar
- Provide external links to official event pages
- Include event images from Zadar's S3 bucket
- Support Croatian date formats and locations

The events will appear on the map at Zadar coordinates (44.1194, 15.2314) and integrate seamlessly with the existing clustering system.
