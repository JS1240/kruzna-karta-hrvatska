# Product Requirements Document: Animated Background & Color Scheme Redesign

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature aims to transform the frontend user experience by implementing an animated background system with a cohesive color scheme across the entire website. The current simple background lacks visual appeal and fails to create a memorable first impression for community members and visitors.

The goal is to create a warm, luxurious, and attractive visual experience that enhances user engagement while maintaining excellent readability and performance. The redesign will use subtle topology animations in strategic sections combined with a carefully applied color palette to establish strong brand perception.

## 2. Goals

1. **Enhance User Engagement**: Create a memorable first-time user experience that encourages return visits
2. **Improve Brand Perception**: Establish a warm, luxurious, and professional visual identity
3. **Maintain Performance**: Implement animations without compromising website performance
4. **Ensure Accessibility**: Keep all content readable and accessible across all devices
5. **Create Visual Hierarchy**: Use strategic placement of animations to guide user attention

## 3. User Stories

- **As a first-time visitor**, I want to be impressed by the visual design so that I remember the website and want to return
- **As a community member**, I want a warm and inviting interface so that I feel welcomed and engaged
- **As a mobile user**, I want smooth animations that don't slow down my browsing experience
- **As a user with accessibility needs**, I want all content to remain clearly readable despite background animations
- **As any user**, I want the website to feel modern and professional so that I trust the platform

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Color Scheme Implementation

1. The system must apply the following color palette consistently across all pages:
   - **Primary Brand Colors**: #3674B5 and #578FCA for buttons, links, and headers
   - **Accent Colors**: #F5F0CD and #FADA7A for highlights and accents
   - **Contrast Colors**: #000000 and #FFFFFF for text and high contrast elements

2. The system must maintain color accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

3. The system must ensure sufficient contrast ratios for all text elements

### 4.2 Animated Background System

1. The system must implement VANTA.TOPOLOGY animations using p5.js library in specific sections only

2. The topology animation must use only blue tones (#3674B5, #578FCA) for consistency

3. The animation must feature:
   - Slow, gentle movements
   - Minimal particle density
   - Low opacity/transparency effects

4. The system must apply blur effects that are adjustable based on content overlay needs

5. The animation must be responsive and adaptive for mobile devices

6. The system must maintain website performance standards (no significant impact on load times or frame rates)

### 4.3 Layout and Sections

1. The system must apply clear white backgrounds to non-animated sections

2. The system must strategically place animated sections to enhance visual hierarchy without overwhelming content

3. The system must ensure all text remains clearly readable over animated backgrounds

4. The system must maintain existing Tailwind CSS component functionality

### 4.4 Technical Implementation

1. The system must integrate p5.min.js and vanta.topology.min.js libraries

2. The system must be compatible with existing Tailwind CSS framework

3. The system must implement responsive design patterns for all screen sizes

4. The system must include fallback options for devices with limited performance capabilities

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Complex Interactive Animations**: No user-controllable or interactive animation elements beyond basic mouse/touch responses
- **Audio Elements**: No sound effects or audio components
- **Video Backgrounds**: No video-based background implementations
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Color scheme will be fixed, not switchable
- **Animation Customization**: Users cannot customize animation settings
- **Legacy Browser Support**: Focus on modern browsers only (IE11 and below not supported)

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Visual Design

- **Animation Placement**: Strategic placement in hero sections, call-to-action areas, and transition zones
- **Blur Implementation**: Gaussian blur with CSS `backdrop-filter` for content overlay areas
- **Typography**: Maintain high contrast ratios for all text elements
- **Component Updates**: Modernize existing components while maintaining Tailwind CSS patterns

### 6.2 User Experience

- **Loading States**: Implement smooth loading transitions for animated elements
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility settings
- **Mobile Optimization**: Lighter animation intensity on mobile devices
- **Touch Interactions**: Appropriate touch controls for mobile users

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Dependencies

- **p5.js**: Latest stable version for animation rendering
- **VANTA.js**: Topology animation library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Maintain existing framework integration

### 7.2 Performance Constraints

- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps on desktop, 30fps minimum on mobile
- **Bundle Size**: Additional libraries should not exceed 500KB total
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and optimize for mobile device memory constraints

### 7.3 Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 13+, Chrome Mobile 80+

### 7.4 Implementation Approach

- **Component Architecture**: Create reusable animation components
- **CSS Variables**: Use CSS custom properties for color scheme management
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality without JavaScript

## 8. Success Metrics

### 8.1 Primary Metrics

- **User Feedback Surveys**: Achieve 80%+ positive feedback on new design
- **Time on Site**: Increase average session duration by 25%
- **Bounce Rate**: Reduce bounce rate by 15%

### 8.2 Secondary Metrics

- **Page Load Performance**: Maintain Core Web Vitals scores (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- **Mobile Performance**: No decrease in mobile page speed scores
- **User Return Rate**: Track if users return after first visit

### 8.3 Measurement Methods

- **User Surveys**: Post-deployment feedback collection
- **Analytics Tracking**: Google Analytics performance monitoring
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse audits and real user monitoring

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Animation Density**: Should different page types (landing, content, forms) have varying animation intensities?

2. **Accessibility Options**: Should there be a toggle to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion?

3. **Content Strategy**: How should existing content be reorganized to work optimally with the new animated sections?

4. **Testing Phase**: What is the preferred approach for A/B testing the new design against the current version?

5. **Rollout Timeline**: Should the implementation be done page-by-page or as a complete redesign?

6. **Fallback Strategy**: What should be the fallback experience for users on very low-end devices?
