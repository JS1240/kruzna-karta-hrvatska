## Subagent Selection Guidelines

### Task Complexity Assessment
- **Simple** (1-2 steps): Consider direct implementation
- **Moderate** (3-5 steps): **ALWAYS use appropriate subagent**
- **Complex** (6+ steps): **ALWAYS use multiple subagents or general-purpose**

### Domain Matching
1. **Identify primary domain**: Backend, frontend, infrastructure, analysis, etc.
2. **Select specialized subagent**: Match task to subagent expertise
3. **Consider secondary domains**: Use multiple subagents for cross-domain tasks
4. **Quality assurance**: Always use reviewer subagents for significant changes

## Best Practices

### Before Starting Any Task
1. **Assess complexity**: Is this a multi-step or specialized task?
2. **Identify domains**: What expertise areas are involved?
3. **Select subagents**: Choose the most appropriate specialized agents
4. **Plan sequence**: Determine if subagents should work in parallel or sequence

### During Development
1. **Use multiple subagents**: Don't rely on a single agent for complex tasks
2. **Leverage specialization**: Each subagent brings unique expertise and patterns
3. **Quality gates**: Always use reviewer subagents for significant changes
4. **Documentation**: Let subagents handle their specialty areas

### Quality Assurance
1. **Code review**: `code-reviewer` for all significant code changes
2. **Architecture review**: `architect-reviewer` for structural changes
3. **Security review**: `security-auditor` for security-sensitive code
4. **Performance review**: `performance-engineer` for optimization needs

## Integration with Development Workflow

**Standard Task Flow**:
1. **Analysis**: Use `general-purpose` or domain-specific analyst
2. **Implementation**: Use appropriate implementation subagents
3. **Testing**: Use `test-automator` and `test-runner`
4. **Review**: Use appropriate reviewer subagents
5. **Deployment**: Use `deployment-engineer` or `devops-troubleshooter`

**Emergency Response Flow**:
1. **Initial response**: `incident-responder` for coordination
2. **Investigation**: `error-detective` for root cause analysis
3. **Resolution**: Domain-specific subagents for fixes
4. **Validation**: `test-runner` and reviewers for verification

This comprehensive subagent system ensures that every task is handled by specialized expertise, resulting in higher quality, more efficient development, and better outcomes for the Croatian Events Platform.
