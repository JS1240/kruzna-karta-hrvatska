# FRONTEND RULES — React · Vite · TailwindCSS · TypeScript (v1.0)

> **Scope**  
> These rules govern all web-frontend code in this repository. They apply to React 19+, Vite 7+, TailwindCSS 3.4+, and TypeScript 5.8+.  
> Animations must follow the **GSAP (Tween / Timeline)** guidelines below; when other motion libraries are used, apply comparable constraints.

---

## 1 · MUST

### 1.1 Coding Standards & Style
- **MUST** enable **`"strict": true`** and all `noUnchecked` flags in `tsconfig.json`.
- **MUST** use **ESLint** with `@typescript-eslint` + **Prettier**; run in pre-commit and CI.  
- **MUST** write components as **function components** with **React hooks**; avoid legacy `class` components.
- **MUST** name files and symbols by intent:  
  - Components → `PascalCase.tsx` (`UserCard.tsx`)  
  - Hooks → `useDescriptiveThing.ts`  
  - Utilities → `camelCase.ts`
- **MUST** colocate component, test, and style files under a feature folder (`/features/user/UserCard.tsx`).
- **MUST** export a single default component per file; named exports for non-components.
- **MUST** add **JSDoc/TSDoc** to every public prop, hook parameter, and return value.

### 1.2 State & Data Flow
- **MUST** favour **React context + hooks** for cross-cutting state; prefer **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** only for complex, shared state.
- **MUST** treat server data as immutable; normalise and cache via **TanStack Query** v5 with intelligent caching strategies.
- **MUST** handle errors and loading states for every async request.
- **MUST** use custom hooks for performance-critical operations like map updates and clustering.

### 1.3 TailwindCSS
- **MUST** enable `content` paths correctly in `tailwind.config.js` to purge unused styles.
- **MUST** compose utility classes with **clsx / classnames** or Tailwind `@apply`; avoid long inline class strings in JSX.
- **MUST** extend the design system in `theme.extend` (colors, spacing, typography); **never** modify Tailwind core.

### 1.4 Accessibility
- **MUST** follow **WCAG 2.1 AA**: semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus outlines.
- **MUST** respect **`prefers-reduced-motion`** by disabling or simplifying animations.
- **MUST** add `aria-*` attributes and labels to interactive elements.

### 1.5 Animations & Motion
- **MUST** implement complex motion with **GSAP** timelines; wrap GSAP calls inside `useLayoutEffect` or custom hooks.
- **MUST** store animation targets via `useRef`; **never** query DOM with `document.querySelector`.
- **MUST** keep each animation < 200 ms for micro-interactions, < 500 ms for page-level transitions.
- **MUST** batch or debounce scroll/resize-based animations (GSAP `ScrollTrigger` or `requestAnimationFrame`).
- **MUST** pause / kill animations on component unmount (`ctx.revert()` or `gsap.killTweensOf`).

### 1.6 Build & Tooling
- **MUST** use **Vite** with `react`, `tsconfig-paths`, and `tailwindcss` plugins.
- **MUST** split vendor and common chunks via Vite’s `build.rollupOptions` → `manualChunks`.
- **MUST** enable HTTPS and HMR in local dev (`vite --https --open`).

### 1.7 Testing & QA
- **MUST** test UI logic with **React Testing Library** and hooks with **@testing-library/react-hooks**.
- **MUST** reach ≥ 90 % statement coverage on critical features.
- **MUST** run **axe-core** accessibility tests in CI.

---

## 2 · SHOULD

### 2.1 Performance & Optimisation
- **SHOULD** memoise heavy components (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
- **SHOULD** lazy-load routes (`React.lazy` + `Suspense`) and large assets (`import.meta.glob` in Vite).
- **SHOULD** enable **`react-refresh`** and **`vite-plugin-inspect`** for dev-time diagnostics.
- **SHOULD** compress SVG/PNG and serve modern formats (WebP/AVIF).

### 2.2 Advanced Motion
- **SHOULD** use **Framer Motion** or **@react-spring/web** for simple UI transitions if GSAP overhead is unjustified.
- **SHOULD** centralise timing and easing in a `motionTokens.ts` file.
- **SHOULD** coordinate page transitions with **React Router** `useNavigationType` + GSAP `context`.

### 2.3 Design & DX
- **SHOULD** abstract repetitive Tailwind patterns into **@/components/ui** primitives (Button, Card).
- **SHOULD** document components in **Storybook** with interactive controls.

### 2.4 Security
- **SHOULD** enable **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers with `vite-plugin-csp`.
- **SHOULD** sanitise all user-generated HTML (use `dompurify`).

---

## 3 · SUGGEST

- Add **pre-commit** hooks (lint, prettier, test, type-check).
- Provide a **VS Code dev-container** with Node LTS, pnpm, and Cypress pre-installed.
- Integrate **Cypress** for E2E tests and visual regression (Percy, Loki, or Playwright-trace).

---

## 4 · DO NOT

### 4.1 Code Smells
- **DO NOT** store non-serialisable objects in React state.
- **DO NOT** mutate props or context.
- **DO NOT** dispatch Redux actions inside render.

### 4.2 Performance
- **DO NOT** trigger layout-thrashing animations; batch DOM reads/writes.
- **DO NOT** mount heavy GSAP timelines eagerly; lazy-initialise in the viewport.

### 4.3 Style
- **DO NOT** write plain CSS/Sass; use Tailwind utilities or `@apply`.
- **DO NOT** override Tailwind base styles in component files.

### 4.4 Security
- **DO NOT** interpolate raw user input into HTML without sanitising.
- **DO NOT** commit `.env` or secret keys.

### 4.5 Version Control
- **DO NOT** commit compiled `dist/` or `.turbo/` artefacts.
- **DO NOT** auto-run `git add` / `git commit`; output proposed messages only.

## Subagents - MANDATORY USAGE RULE

**🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENT: ALWAYS use subagents for complex, multi-step tasks, domain-specific work, and comprehensive analysis. This is MANDATORY, not optional.**

### Core Mandate for Development

- **Complex Tasks** (3+ steps): **MUST** use appropriate specialized subagents
- **Domain-Specific Work**: **MUST** leverage domain expertise (backend, frontend, security, performance)
- **Production Issues**: **MUST** use incident response and troubleshooting subagents
- **Quality Assurance**: **MUST** use reviewer subagents for all significant changes
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: **MUST** use analytical subagents for system-wide work

### Mandatory Subagent Reference
**📖 Complete subagent documentation**: [`Subagents.md`](./Subagents.md)

**Key Categories Available**:

- 🏗️ **Development & Implementation**: `backend-architect`, `frontend-component-builder`, `python-expert`, `javascript-pro`
- 🔍 **Analysis & Quality**: `code-reviewer`, `architect-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `performance-engineer`
- 🌐 **Infrastructure & Operations**: `devops-troubleshooter`, `cloud-architect`, `database-optimizer`
- 🧠 **Specialized Domains**: `ai-engineer`, `data-engineer`, `ui-ux-designer`
- 📋 **Business & Documentation**: `prd-specialist`, `business-analyst`, `content-marketer`
- 🧪 **Quality & Testing**: `test-automator`, `test-runner`, `dx-optimizer`

### Croatian Events Platform Mandatory Workflows

- **New feature development**: Domain subagent → Implementation subagent → Quality reviewer
- **Production incidents**: `incident-responder` → `error-detective` → Domain specialist
- **Code changes**: Implementation subagent → `code-reviewer` → `architect-reviewer` (if structural)
- **Performance issues**: `performance-engineer` → Domain specialist → Testing validation

**⚠️ VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**: Not using subagents for complex tasks results in lower quality, missed expertise, and potential system issues. Always reference [`Subagents.md`](./Subagents.md) for detailed usage guidelines.
